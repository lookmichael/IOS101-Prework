## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Spotify 

- Display friend's listening activity on the app
- Display next song queued

Tiktok

- Watching tiktoks with friends at the same time
- Categories for different types of content

Instagram

- Add a map that shows live location to selected friends
- Add a memories section for past stories posted

App Idea:

A comprehensive study and productivity app designed to support students. It'll include a progress tracker to monitor study hours and achievements. As well as options to set different goals and receive study-related reminders. To enhance collaboration, the app will also facilitate study groups, allowing for students to connect with peers studying similar materials.

## Notes

Getting used to SWIFT is difficult but doable.
